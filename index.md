<!-- # Interactive Animation Design with Processing -->
This page collects my visual design showcases. I use [Processing](https://processing.org/) (Java mode) to create the interactive animations presented here. These works are proof of concepts developed for [laputamega](https://www.laputamega.com), a Chinese game design company. 


## Cartoon 
> The animated cartoon figures in this section are created with [Box2D](https://box2d.org/), a 2D physics engine.  In the animation the motion of the figures is simulated as in the physical world. Figures interact with each other based on gravity, collision and forces applied by users.
>  - [Mr Squishy](pages/blob.html#content): Squishy Blobs with big eyes can jump and squeeze each other.

>  - [Misty Landscape](pages/landscape.html#content): "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains", a masterpiece of traditional Chinese painting, integrated with dense misty flows of green and blue colors.
>  - [Flowing Starry Night](pages/starrynight.html#content): Starry Night with floating liquid sparkles flowing across the sky.
