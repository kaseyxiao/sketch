<!-- # Interactive Animation Design with Processing -->
This collection shows my visual design showcases. I use [Processing](https://processing.org/) (Java mode) to create all the interactive animations in the showcases. These works are designed for the projects at [laputamega](www.laputamega.com), a Chinese game design company. 


- Cartoon
>We create animated cartoon figures with Processing and [Box2D](https://box2d.org/), a 2D physics engine.  In these animations, we simulates motions in the physical world such as gravity, collision and forces applied by users.

- Painting
>We attempt to render classic paintings with a flavor Classic paintings could be reinterpreted with animations and interaction by particle systems techniques

  - [Chinese Landscape Painting](pages/landscape.html)

  >the use of green and blue colors of Tang for creating of huge landscapes

  - [Starry Night](pages/starrynight.html)

- Typography
>Text is a prominent component in the digital design. We use algorithms to create visual effects to render text.
