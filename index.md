<!-- # Interactive Animation Design with Processing -->
This page is a portfolio that collects my visual design showcases. I use [Processing](https://processing.org/) (Java mode) to create the interactive animations presented here. These works are proof of concepts developed for
<!--[laputamega](http://www.laputamega.com)-->*laputamega.com*. 


## Cartoon 
> The animated cartoon figures in this section are created with [Box2D](https://box2d.org/), a 2D physics engine.  In the animation the motion of the figures is simulated as in the physical world. Figures interact with each other based on gravity, collision and forces applied by users.

## Painting
> The designs below aim at adding movement into classic paintings with particle systems.
>  - [Misty Landscape](pages/landscape.html#content): A section of "A Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains", a masterpiece of traditional Chinese painting, integrated with dense misty flows of vibrant green and blue colors. Users can apply wind force to the mist. 
>  - [Flowing Starry Night](pages/starrynight.html#content): Starry Night with floating liquid sparkles flowing across the sky.

## Typography
> This section devotes to  demonstrate artistic visual effects for rendering text.
